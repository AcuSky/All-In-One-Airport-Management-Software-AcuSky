## Space Management
**See It. Track It. Bill It. All in One Platform.**

AcuSky connects space mapping with billing, tenants, and analytics to give airports complete operational clarity.

AcuSky Space Management gives airports total visibility and control over every gate, counter, kiosk, office, and storage area — fully connected to billing, tenants, and operations.

## The Problem
### Disconnected Maps and Spreadsheets Drain Airport Revenue

Most airports still manage physical space using outdated CAD layers, static PDFs, or manual spreadsheets.

- When space changes hands, systems lag behind  
- When tenants move or expand, billing falls out of sync  

Legacy tools can map space — but they cannot manage it.

---

## The Solution
### Smart Mapping Meets Real-Time Data

AcuSky Space Management brings GIS-ready visualization, real-time occupancy tracking, and billing integration together in one intelligent platform — so every square foot of your airport earns its keep.

---

## Key Capabilities

- Digitally map every gate, office, kiosk, and utility meter with real-time occupancy status  
- Connect each space to its tenant record, lease, and billing history for instant transparency  
- Assign meters and allocations by space or tenant and automate utility billing through AcuSky ABRM  
- Track every modification — moves, expansions, and reassignments — with full audit logs  
- Visualize usage by terminal, zone, or tenant type to identify under-utilized areas instantly  
- Store floor plans, lease exhibits, and maintenance files in a version-controlled, searchable repository

## Modular by Design. Future-Proof by Default.

Legacy airport mapping tools are rigid and brittle — change one field and everything breaks.

AcuSky’s clean, modular architecture ensures:

- Long-term stability and scalability  
- Faster updates without system downtime  
- Independent modules for mapping, utilities, billing, and analytics that communicate seamlessly  
- Easy addition of new features, integrations, and data feeds without costly rewrites  

Modern airports deserve software that expands as fast as they do.
